         <h1>First Article</h1>
         <h3>Posted on 3 February 2023. This is about <em>Duffy the Disney Bear's creation story!</em></h3>
         </header>
         <p><span class="highlight">Duffy's current creation story started a long, long time ago in <em>2004</em>. <em>Mickey Mouse</em> was <em>lonely</em> because he was a sea captain and <em>missed his friends</em> while sailing. 
                     So one day, <em>Minnie Mouse</em> decided to sew a <em>special teddy bear</em> for him to bring on <em>sailing trips in a duffel bag.</em> That's why <em>Mickey</em> decided to name him <em>Duffy</em>! <em>Duffy</em> has a <em>hip Mickey birthmark</em> and the <em>shape of Mickey's face</em>. One night when<em> Mickey</em> was asleep, he 
                     dreamt that <em>Duffy</em> <em>magically came alive</em> in a sailor costume, and said that they would <em>go on adventures together</em>. The next morning,
                     he was <em>shocked</em> when he woke up to find <em>Duffy</em> looking <em>exactly</em> like he was in the dream! <em>Duffy</em> is <em>Mickey's special buddy</em> and accompanies him on many adventures,
                     so now <em>Mickey</em> is <em>not lonely anymore</em>. Mickey swears that even to this day, when he turns around, he catches <em>Duffy</em> <em>peeking and winking</em> at him!
